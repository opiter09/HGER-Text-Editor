# HGER-Text-Editor
This is a text editing tool for the NDS game History: Great Empires - Rome. It is a set of two Python code files, one of which will split a .str file into its
component strings, and the other of which will join it back together into a new "output" file. Please note that both require you to pass the .str file as an
argument (or drag and drop it onto the batch file). This code supports all languages, however please note that not all text in the game is contained in the .str
files. Notably, the Legionnaire quizzes are stored in separate plain-text files in the ROM, which can be very easily edited on their own.

Also, this code was designed for the American version of the game. I see no reason why the European version would not work with it as well, but if problems arise
from that, please do let me know.
