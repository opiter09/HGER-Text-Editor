# HGER-Text-Editor
This is a text editing tool for the NDS game History: Great Empires - Rome. It is a set of two python code files, one of which will split a .str file into its
component strings, and the other of which will join it back together into a new "output" file. Please note that both require you to pass the str file as an
argument (or drag and drop it onto the batch file). This code supports all languages, however please note that not all text in the game is contained in the .str
files. Notably, the Legionnaire quizzes are stored in separate plain-text files in the ROM, which can be very easiy edited on their own.

Also, this code was designed for the American version of the game. While the languages between the American and European versions are the same, the fact that eact
.str file in the American version had their own little quirks to work out leads me to believe that the European files might not work perfectly. If so, please let me
know, and I will try and account for any differences there.
